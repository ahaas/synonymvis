Todo:
* Add comments to document renderer.js
* Refactor renderer.js
* Try to keep query word centered
* Investigate failure to completely erase previous renders
* Make choice of colors better (not truely random)
* Idea: isolate groups. Smaller groups have fainter colors. Darken on mouseover?
* Smoothly handle words with no results
